properties:
  mode:
    description:

  assoc-steering:
    description:
      Allow rejecting assoc requests for steering purposes.
    type: boolean
    default: false
  required-snr:
    description:
      Minimum required signal level (dBm) for connected clients. The client
      will be kicked if the SNR drops below this value.
    type: integer
    default: 0
  required-probe-snr:
    description:
      Minimum required signal level (dBm) to allow connections. If the SNR is
      below this value, probe requests will not be replied to.

    default: 0
  required-roam-snr:
    description:
      Minimum required signal level (dBm) before an attempt is made to roam the
      client to a better AP.
    type: integer
    default: 0
  load-kick-threshold:
    description:
      Minimum channel load (%) before kicking clients
    type: integer
    default: 0

    description:
      Allow multiple instances of the steering daemon to coordinate the best channel
      usage amongst eachother.

  ipv6:
    description:
      Use IPv6 multicast to communicate with remote usteerd instances, rather
