      The physical network devices that shall be considered the primary uplink interface.
      All classification and shaping will happen on this device.
    type: array
    items:
      type: string
      default: WAN
  bandwidth-up:
    description:
      Defines the upload bandwidth of this device. If it is not known or the device is
      attached to a shared medium, this value needs to be 0.
