properties:
  mode:
    description:
      Specifies the DHCPv6 server operation mode. When set to "stateless", the system will announce
      router advertisements only, without offering stateful DHCPv6 service. When set to "stateful",
      emitted router advertisements will instruct clients to obtain a DHCPv6 lease. When set to
      "hybrid", clients can freely chose whether to self-assign a random address through SLAAC,
      whether to request an address via DHCPv6, or both.
      For maximum compatibility with different clients, it is recommended to use the hybrid mode.
      The special mode "relay" will instruct the unit to act as DHCPv6 relay between this interface
      and any of the IPv6 interfaces in "upstream" mode.
    type: string
    enum:
    - "hybrid"
    - "stateless"
    - "stateful"
    - "relay"
  announce-dns:
    description:
      Overrides the DNS server to announce in DHCPv6 and RA messages. By default, the device will
      announce its own local interface address as DNS server, essentially acting as proxy for
      downstream clients. By specifying a non-empty list of IPv6 addresses here, this default
      behaviour can be overridden.

  filter-prefix:
    description:
      Selects a specific downstream prefix or a number of downstream prefix ranges to announce in
      DHCPv6 and RA messages. By default, all prefixes configured on a given downstream interface
      are advertised. By specifying an IPv6 prefix in CIDR notation here, only prefixes covered by
      this CIDR are selected.
