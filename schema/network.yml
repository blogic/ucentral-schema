                assign a random address through SLAAC, whether to request an address via DHCPv6, or both.
                For maximum compatibility with different clients, it is recommended to use the hybrid mode.
                The special mode "relay" will instruct the unit to act as DHCPv6 relay between this interface

                on this interface for redistribution via DHCPv6. Setting this value to 64 disables
                DHCPv6-PD since there will be no prefixes to redistribute.
