  This section describes the IPv6 properties of a logical interface.
type: object
properties:
  addressing:
    description:
      This option defines the method by which the IPv6 subnet of the interface
      is acquired. In static addressing mode, the specified subnet and gateway,
      if any, are configured on the interface in a fixed manner. Also - if a
      prefix size hint is specified - a prefix of the given size is allocated
      from each upstream received prefix delegation pool and assigned to the
      interface. In dynamic addressing mode, a DHCPv6 client will be launched to
      obtain IPv6 prefixes for the interface itself and for downstream
      delegation. Note that dynamic addressing usually only ever makes sense on
      upstream interfaces.
    type: string
    enum:
      - dynamic
      - static
  subnet:
    description:
      This option defines a static IPv6 prefix in CIDR notation to set on the
      logical interface. A special notation "auto/64" can be used, causing the
      configuration agent to automatically allocate a suitable prefix from the
      IPv6 address pool specified in globals.ipv6-network. This property only
      applies to static addressing mode. Note that this is usually not needed
      due to DHCPv6-PD assisted prefix assignment.
    type: string
    format: uc-cidr6
    examples:
    - auto/64
  gateway:
    description:
      This option defines the static IPv6 gateway of the logical interface. It
      only applies to static addressing mode. Note that this is usually not
      needed due to DHCPv6-PD assisted prefix assignment.
    type: string
    format: ipv6
    examples:
    - 2001:db8:123:456::1
  prefix-size:
    description:
      For dynamic addressing interfaces, this property specifies the prefix size
      to request from an upstream DHCPv6 server through prefix delegation. For
      static addressing interfaces, it specifies the size of the sub-prefix to
      allocate from the upstream-received delegation prefixes for assignment to
      the logical interface.

    maximum: 64
